## Description

This is my first project as a front-end developer.
It is my personal site that also serves as a portfolio for further projects.
The website is very simple.
It consists of only 4 html pages in addition to the curriculum always created in html and css.

Html files are:
-index.html
-skills.html
-projects.html
-contacts.html
-curriculum.html

Finally, in the assets folder there are:
-the images folder
-the css file | style.css
-the javascript file  | app.js

## How to install

To open the project you only need a browser and an internet connection.

## HTML files

All HTML pages contain a navbar (disappearing on mobile devices) and a section.

The contact page contains a form connected to my personal email using Email js

## assets
### CSS
In addition to the CSS stylesheet, the Bootstrap framework was used.
### JavaScript
Javascript was only used for the Emailjs function and a function related to page scrolling.
### Curriculum
The curriculum was created entirely in HTML and CSS.
It is therefore also responsive
